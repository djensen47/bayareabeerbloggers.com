Holy crap!  SF Beer Week just sort of snuck up on us, didn’t it?  Here we were, just sipping away on our favorite suds while others were working overtime for no pay to bring us this awesome cultural phenomenon.

If you haven’t checked out the Beer Week website yet, it’s full of amazing goodies that will help you maximize your beer intake, make sure you won’t miss awesome events, and help plan your itinerary as well.  The itinerary feature is probably the best thing we’ve seen since… well, a while.  You can plan your events by day, map out a route, everything.  It boggles the mind.

Just remember, although BART is handy, they don’t really run trains past 12:20am, so make sure you don’t get stuck somewhere.  You’d think they would have gotten their act together and run the train system like a real metropolitan area should.  Ah well.

We hope to have some interesting articles about SF Beer Week coming up, like places you should hit, things to avoid, etc.  Keep your eyes peeled!
