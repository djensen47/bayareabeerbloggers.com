Welcome to the newly redesigned Bay Area Beer Bloggers website! The most important goal of the new website is to promote the bloggers who make up the Bay Area Beer Bloggers. As such, the directory of beer bloggers is listed on the homepage.

New to the directory of bloggers is a section for industry beer blogs, including the blog for the San Francisco Brewer's Guild. Eventually we will also include a list of former BABB bloggers.

Other possible plans for the new site include promoting our meet ups and more blog articles. Stay tuned!
