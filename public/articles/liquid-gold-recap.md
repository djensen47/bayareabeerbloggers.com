A few weeks ago a the San Francisco Bay Area Bere Bloggers met at one of San Francisco's 
newest craft beer establishments, [Liquid Gold Tap Room and Bottle Shop](http://www.liquidgoldsf.com).

Liquid Gold opened on October 25, 2014 and is located on Hyde St. between California and Pine. They feature 30 rotating craft beers on draft plus a large cold display case of bottled beers. In addition to beer, they server 2 wines on tap, bottled wine, and 1 cider on tap.  Like similar shops, Liquid Gold allows you to purchase bottles for consumption at the bar or to take home. The taproom is clean, trendy, comfortable, has two televisions, and a large display for their digital menu.

Owner Tim Lee, a San Francisco native, wanted the bar to pay homage to San Francisco's roots not only in name but also with the art on the walls and the beers served. Liquid Gold carries and serves craft beer from all over America but highlights local beer from San Francisco, the Bay Area, and Northern California.

I certainly enjoyed visiting and have been back three times since our that first visit. I highly recommend checking it out.
