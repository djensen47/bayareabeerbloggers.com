What another great night out on the town with the BABB.  I was so happy to see so many come out for a pint at Gordon Biersch.  I’ve walked past it plenty of times but never went in, I think a lot of us were in the same boat.

The patio was great, could have used a table or two more and some heat, but it was a stellar view.  I highly suggest going there on a hot day and drinking a cool lager.  It was great to hear about Beer By Bart’s trip around Europe and the different beer locations they hit up, it was also great to see some new faces like Cory and his wife from Brew Review who is new to the group not a few days ago.  He’s working on a beer App for the iPhone and if anyone is interested in testing it out and giving feedback hit him up on his website.

From there we walked to the Public House where I griped possibly the whole time about their keg display, I’m sure that got annoying.  So much cash in the form of aluminum kegs went into that, seems sad they won’t be used for beer anymore.  And from there we walked to 21A and closed the night, leaving Jen and I to run for the second-to-last BART train (which we missed sadly).

As for the business end of things, I didn’t get to talk to too many people about some ideas since it was such a large group and people were socializing, but I got some good feedback.

I think we can all agree that the BABB is a great social club.  It’s great to hang out, share ideas, concepts, info, gossip, stories, etc.  For now we should treat it as such and keep it as a social club.  Organizing events under the BABB name might be a little more than we can chew.

Speaking of events, when people hold events or want to do something with the BABB crew, just give a shout out on the list and see what happens.  Want to host a bottle share?  Let us know!  Doing a trip up to Russian River?  See if anyone wants to chip in for a hotel room.  Informal is the way to go, no need to make a big deal of it.

The last thing is about the BABB website.  It needs content, every day, and we need volunteers to help with the coding/layout/whatever.  Feel free to respond with your own concepts, but the idea floating around in my head is a central website that has constantly revolving articles from all our respective websites, and increase traffic to our personal sites.  The layout would look kinda like a newspaper, with titles and the first half-paragraph from the respective article with a “continued” link at the end taking the reader to the original article on the persons webpage.

This would be a good way to not only have a ton of Bay Area beer articles and reviews in one spot, but since it would only feature snippets it would make the reader click through to our individual websites.  The increased linkage between all our sites alone should drive us to the top of search results (hopefully).

Thoughts?  Ideas?  It’s not mandatory either, you can opt-out of having partial articles appear on the BABB site.  Nobody will force anyone to do anything they don’t want to.

Anyways, our next meet-up is at Van Houten Brewing on July 13th at 7pm.  Let’s make a strong showing!
