One of the best parts of being affiliated with the BABB group is (obviously) the affinity we all share for beer. Not just writing about it, reviewing it, researching it, brewing it, or discussing it, but perhaps most importantly, *sharing* it. As an added bonus, this particular brand of beer enthusiast tends to keep a well stocked cellar.

Just before the holiday schedules went crazy for everyone at the end of the year, we decided it was time to coordinate on the next big share. The date was set, the location (the art studios of [Gazelle & Goat](http://gazelleandgoat.com)) was available, and a [somewhat OCD spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1GqgfvayIwnTaa8L5_mgdg7wJJbdjPwF9CbClPAVZHeM/edit?usp=sharing) was drawn up to build some tasty verticals. Take for example this Firestone Walker lineup:

When it all went down, we humans and our mere mortal livers were greatly outnumbered. People brought their A-game, with bottles they'd announced, and many more they did not. In the end, it was an endurance race to even taste all these beers, some of which were pure unobtanium.

Let's cut to the chase - here's an (at least partial) list of what was cracked open:

Ultimately, we have to admit, the beers won. In the end, some of these amazing beers had to go down the drain. A few were left unopened, but everyone that brought beer shared their most special bottles. We all got to taste myriad whales, and for that to happen, everyone was willing to open more than they could drink. That's the kind of holiday spirit of generosity any beer lover would appreciate. In hindsight, the next day, many of us vowed never to drink another beer (hah!), but as the days creep on, there's already chatter about how we can top this in 2015.
