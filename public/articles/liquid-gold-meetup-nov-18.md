It's been a while since our last meetup but so to kick things off again, we will be meeting at the newly opened Liquid Gold bottle shop and tap room on November 18.

If you're a beer blogger or you just enjoy craft beer (and like to read about it once in a while), please join us at our next meetup. So far we have a least 5 bloggers who plan on showing up. If there's time after Liquid Gold, we can check out one or two other craft beer destinations in the Nob/Russian Hill area.

Details:

- **Location**: Liquid Gold
- **Address**: 1040 Hyde St., San Francisco, CA 94109
- **Time**: 7pm until 9pm (or later)
